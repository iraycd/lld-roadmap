## 1. Fundamentals

### 1.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Abstraction** – Hide complex details behind a simple interface.  
- **Encapsulation** – Keep related data and methods in one place.  
- **Inheritance** – Derive new classes from existing ones.  
- **Polymorphism** – Implement different behaviors under a single interface.

### 1.2 Clean Code
- **Meaningful naming conventions** – Use descriptive, consistent names.  
- **Readable and modular code** – Keep your code structured and easy to understand.  
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Abstract repeated logic into reusable components.  
- **Refactoring techniques** – Continuously improve code structure without changing behavior.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 SOLID Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Each class should have one responsibility.  
2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** – Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** – Subtypes must be replaceable for their supertypes.  
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** – Clients shouldn’t depend on unused interfaces.  
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** – High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

### 2.2 Other Principles
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** – Favor simplicity over complexity.  
- **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)** – Avoid implementing what you don’t currently need.  
- **Separation of Concerns** – Organize code into distinct sections based on functionality.  
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Reiterated here for emphasis on reusability.

- **State**  
- **Template Method**  
- **Visitor**  
- **Interpreter**

## 4. Systematic Design Thinking

### 4.1 Requirements Analysis
- **Functional requirements** – Features the system must provide.  
- **Non-functional requirements** – Performance, scalability, security, etc.

### 4.2 Modeling Techniques
- **UML diagrams** – Class, Sequence, Use-Case for visualizing designs.  
- **State machines and workflows** – Representing system states and transitions.

### 4.3 Step-by-Step Design Process
1. Identify entities and relationships.  
2. Break down the problem into components.  
3. Optimize for scalability, modularity, and clarity.
