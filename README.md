## 1. Fundamentals

### 1.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Abstraction** – Hide complex details behind a simple interface.  
- **Encapsulation** – Keep related data and methods in one place.  
- **Inheritance** – Derive new classes from existing ones.  
- **Polymorphism** – Implement different behaviors under a single interface.

### 1.2 Clean Code
- **Meaningful naming conventions** – Use descriptive, consistent names.  
- **Readable and modular code** – Keep your code structured and easy to understand.  
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Abstract repeated logic into reusable components.  
- **Refactoring techniques** – Continuously improve code structure without changing behavior.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 SOLID Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Each class should have one responsibility.  
2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** – Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** – Subtypes must be replaceable for their supertypes.  
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** – Clients shouldn’t depend on unused interfaces.  
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** – High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

### 2.2 Other Principles
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** – Favor simplicity over complexity.  
- **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)** – Avoid implementing what you don’t currently need.  
- **Separation of Concerns** – Organize code into distinct sections based on functionality.  
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Reiterated here for emphasis on reusability.

---

## 3. Design Patterns
### 3.1 Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**  
  - **Quick Note**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
  - **Web Example**: Database connection pool or API client instance (e.g., a shared instance of `MongoDB` or `Axios` for HTTP requests).  

- **Factory**  
  - **Quick Note**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
  - **Web Example**: A factory function that generates different types of form input elements (`TextInput`, `Checkbox`, `RadioButton`) based on a configuration.

- **Abstract Factory**  
  - **Quick Note**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
  - **Web Example**: A factory for generating UI components for different platforms (e.g., `MaterialUI` vs. `Bootstrap` components).

- **Builder**  
  - **Quick Note**: Constructs a complex object step by step, allowing customization of the object’s construction process.  
  - **Web Example**: Building a dynamic query object for a search filter in a REST API.

- **Prototype**  
  - **Quick Note**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype).  
  - **Web Example**: Cloning objects like deeply nested JSON data structures to modify without affecting the original.

---

### 3.2 Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**  
  - **Quick Note**: Converts one interface to another so that incompatible systems can work together.  
  - **Web Example**: Adapting legacy SOAP-based APIs to work with RESTful APIs in a modern web app.

- **Bridge**  
  - **Quick Note**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.  
  - **Web Example**: Decoupling front-end theme management (dark mode vs. light mode) from specific CSS or style implementations.

- **Composite**  
  - **Quick Note**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, enabling uniform treatment of individual objects and compositions.  
  - **Web Example**: Managing nested UI components like menus, where each menu or submenu is treated uniformly.

- **Decorator**  
  - **Quick Note**: Dynamically adds behaviors to an object without altering its structure.  
  - **Web Example**: Adding middleware to HTTP requests in `Express.js` (e.g., logging, authentication, or validation).

- **Façade**  
  - **Quick Note**: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code or subsystem.  
  - **Web Example**: A helper service that combines multiple API calls into a single function for easier use on the front end.

- **Flyweight**  
  - **Quick Note**: Shares common parts of an object to minimize memory usage and improve performance.  
  - **Web Example**: Sharing CSS styles between components using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

- **Proxy**  
  - **Quick Note**: Acts as a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.  
  - **Web Example**: Using a proxy server for API requests in development to handle CORS issues or route traffic through secure endpoints.

---

### 3.3 Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**  
  - **Quick Note**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.  
  - **Web Example**: Real-time notifications in a web app using WebSockets or event listeners in JavaScript for DOM updates.

- **Strategy**  
  - **Quick Note**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable to be used at runtime.  
  - **Web Example**: Different strategies for form validation (e.g., client-side, server-side, or hybrid).

- **Command**  
  - **Quick Note**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.  
  - **Web Example**: Undo/redo functionality in a text editor or a web-based drawing app.

- **Iterator**  
  - **Quick Note**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.  
  - **Web Example**: Iterating through a paginated API response to display data in an infinite scroll view.

- **Mediator**  
  - **Quick Note**: Centralizes communication between objects to reduce dependencies between them.  
  - **Web Example**: A central event bus in frameworks like Vue.js or React Context API to handle component communication.

- **Memento**  
  - **Quick Note**: Captures and restores an object's internal state without exposing its implementation.  
  - **Web Example**: Saving the state of a form or a draft in a rich-text editor.

- **Chain of Responsibility**  
  - **Quick Note**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers where each handler decides to process it or pass it further.  
  - **Web Example**: Middleware chaining in `Express.js`, where requests are processed or passed to the next handler.

- **State**  
  - **Quick Note**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
  - **Web Example**: Managing UI states in a React application (e.g., toggling between `loading`, `success`, and `error` states).

- **Template Method**  
  - **Quick Note**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to define specific steps.  
  - **Web Example**: Base components in React or Angular that define the structure, allowing child components to override specific parts.

- **Visitor**  
  - **Quick Note**: Allows adding new operations to objects without modifying their structure by separating the operation logic.  
  - **Web Example**: A tool that traverses and processes all elements of a DOM tree to apply specific actions like analytics tracking.

- **Interpreter**  
  - **Quick Note**: Defines a grammar for a language and interprets sentences in that language using the grammar.  
  - **Web Example**: Parsing and interpreting search query strings or filters for an e-commerce app.

## 4. Systematic Design Thinking

### 4.1 Requirements Analysis
Effective requirements analysis involves asking the right questions, understanding the problem deeply, and clarifying ambiguities. Follow these steps:

#### **Gathering Requirements**
- **Ask Questions About Functional Requirements**
  - What are the core features of the system?  
  - What inputs and outputs are expected?  
  - What workflows or user actions need to be supported?  
  - Are there edge cases or specific scenarios to handle?  
  - Who are the primary users, and what are their goals?

- **Ask Questions About Non-Functional Requirements**
  - What is the expected load on the system (e.g., users, requests per second)?  
  - How should the system respond to failure (resilience)?  
  - What level of security is needed (e.g., encryption, authentication)?  
  - Are there constraints for scalability, performance, or latency?  
  - What are the maintainability and extensibility expectations?

- **Clarify Business Goals**
  - What problem is the system solving for the business?  
  - How does success look for the stakeholders?  
  - What are the budget and timeline constraints?  

- **Document Assumptions and Constraints**
  - What external systems or APIs does the solution rely on?  
  - What technologies or frameworks are mandated?  
  - Are there compliance or regulatory requirements?  

#### **Think Systemically**
- How will data flow through the system?  
- What integrations or dependencies exist (e.g., third-party APIs)?  
- Are there long-term goals to consider (future-proofing)?  

#### **Validating Requirements**
- Create user stories or scenarios to validate understanding.  
- Prioritize requirements based on impact and feasibility.  
- Collaborate with stakeholders to resolve ambiguities.

### 4.2 Modeling Techniques
Use modeling tools to represent and visualize your design for better clarity and communication:

- **UML Diagrams**  
  - **Class Diagram**: Define entities, their attributes, and relationships.  
  - **Sequence Diagram**: Depict the interactions between objects over time.  
  - **Use-Case Diagram**: Highlight user interactions with the system.

- **State Machines and Workflows**  
  - Represent system states and transitions (e.g., `Order` state transitioning from `Pending` → `Shipped` → `Delivered`).  
  - Define workflows for processes like user registration, checkout, or API request handling.

---

### 4.3 Step-by-Step Design Process

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Revisit the gathered requirements and confirm understanding.  
   - Identify constraints (e.g., budget, technology stack).  
   - Break the problem into smaller sub-problems.

2. **Identify Entities and Relationships**
   - Define the core objects in the system (e.g., `User`, `Product`, `Order`).  
   - Map relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).  
   - Document key attributes and behaviors for each entity.

3. **Define System Boundaries**
   - Identify what is in scope and out of scope for the system.  
   - Determine the interfaces (e.g., REST APIs, database access).

4. **Divide into Components**
   - Break the system into logical modules (e.g., `Authentication`, `Order Management`).  
   - Ensure components are loosely coupled and highly cohesive.  
   - Define clear APIs or contracts for communication between modules.

5. **Design Data Flow**
   - Define how data moves between components (e.g., user input → backend → database → response).  
   - Map out CRUD operations for core entities.

6. **Focus on Scalability and Modularity**
   - Choose scalable patterns (e.g., microservices, load balancing).  
   - Ensure each component can evolve independently.  
   - Avoid monolithic designs unless simplicity is a priority.

7. **Optimize for Performance**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks early (e.g., query-heavy modules).  
   - Use caching, indexing, and efficient algorithms where needed.

8. **Add Fault Tolerance and Resilience**
   - Plan for failures (e.g., retries, circuit breakers).  
   - Define a monitoring and alerting strategy.

9. **Document the Design**
   - Use diagrams, descriptions, and specifications for clarity.  
   - Highlight trade-offs and decisions made during design.

10. **Review and Iterate**
    - Share the design with peers or stakeholders for feedback.  
    - Revise based on practical constraints or new insights.

---

> **Pro Tip**: Always validate your design with real-world scenarios, prototypes, or test cases before implementation. Focus on making the design extensible and maintainable for long-term success.

## 6. Architectural Styles

### 6.1 Clean Architecture

**Concept**: Focuses on separating responsibilities into layers, with the core business logic (domain) being technology-agnostic.

**Layers**:

1. **Domain**: Core business logic and rules, independent of technology.
   * Example: Calculate order total and apply discounts in an e-commerce system.

2. **Application**: Orchestrates use cases by coordinating domain logic and external systems.
   * Example: "Place Order" workflow validates the cart, processes payment, and creates the order.

3. **Interface**: Handles user interaction or communication with external clients.
   * Example: REST API endpoint for users to submit an order.

4. **Infrastructure**: Manages technical details like databases, APIs, and frameworks.
   * Example: Database setup for storing orders or integration with payment gateways.

#### Example File Structure:

```
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   │   ├── Order.py
│   │   ├── Customer.py
│   ├── value_objects/
│   │   ├── Money.py
│   ├── policies/
│   │   ├── DiscountPolicy.py
│   └── validators/
│       ├── OrderValidator.py
├── application/
│   ├── use_cases/
│   │   ├── PlaceOrderUseCase.py
│   │   ├── TransferMoneyUseCase.py
│   ├── services/
│       ├── PaymentService.py
│       ├── NotificationService.py
├── interface/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── OrderController.py
│   │   ├── CustomerController.py
│   ├── views/
│       ├── OrderView.html
│       ├── CustomerProfileView.html
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── repositories/
│   │   ├── OrderRepositoryImpl.py
│   │   ├── CustomerRepositoryImpl.py
│   ├── adapters/
│   │   ├── PaymentGatewayAdapter.py
│   │   ├── EmailServiceAdapter.py
│   ├── config/
│       ├── DatabaseConfig.py
│       ├── AppConfig.py
```

### 6.2 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Concept**: Focuses on designing software that mirrors the business domain closely.

**Key Elements**:

1. **Entities and Value Objects**: Represent domain concepts with a clear identity or immutable value.
   * Example: An Order entity with Money as a value object for prices.

2. **Aggregates and Repositories**: Group related entities and provide access to them.
   * Example: OrderRepository manages CRUD operations for orders.

3. **Bounded Contexts**: Divide the system into independent, domain-specific areas.
   * Example: Separate contexts for Inventory and Billing.

4. **Ubiquitous Language**: Use shared terminology across code and stakeholders.
   * Example: Everyone refers to "Order Total" the same way in discussions and in code.

*Note: File structure similar to Clean Architecture, with emphasis on business logic over technical concerns.*

### 6.3 Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

**Concept**: Decouples core business logic (domain) from external systems using ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations).

**Key Benefits**:
1. Core logic remains testable and independent of frameworks or external systems.
2. Adapters enable seamless integration with different delivery mechanisms (e.g., REST APIs, CLI, queues).

#### Example File Structure:

```
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── ports/
│   │   ├── PaymentPort.py
├── application/
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── OrderService.py
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── adapters/
│   │   ├── StripeAdapter.py
│   │   ├── PaypalAdapter.py
```

### 6.4 Event-Driven Architecture

**Concept**: Systems communicate via events instead of direct calls.

**Key Features**:
1. **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: Producers emit events; consumers act on them.
2. **Scalability**: Loosely coupled components improve scalability.
3. **Example**: An e-commerce system where the order service emits an "OrderPlaced" event consumed by the inventory and notification services.

### 6.5 Microservices Architecture

**Concept**: Decomposes the system into small, independently deployable services.

**Key Features**:
1. **Service Boundaries**: Each service handles a single business capability.
2. **Inter-Service Communication**: Uses REST APIs, gRPC, or message brokers like Kafka.
3. **Example**: A UserService manages user profiles, while a PaymentService handles transactions.

### 6.6 Monolithic Architecture

**Concept**: All components reside in a single deployable unit.

* **Advantages**: Simple development and deployment for small systems.
* **Challenges**: Difficult to scale and maintain as complexity grows.

### 6.7 Client-Server Architecture

**Concept**: Separation of roles between client (user-facing) and server (data and logic).
* Example: A web application where the browser (client) communicates with the backend (server).

### 6.8 Layered Architecture

**Concept**: Divides the system into layers such as Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access.
* Example: MVC frameworks often follow this style.

### Why Architectural Styles Matter

1. **Adaptability**: Choose the right style based on system needs (e.g., scalability, fault tolerance).
2. **Combination**: Many systems use hybrid architectures (e.g., Microservices + Event-Driven).
3. **Clarity**: Consistent layering and separation of concerns improve maintainability.

---
## 7. Distributed Systems and Microservices

### 7.1 Microservices Design
- **Concept**: Microservices break a system into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Service Boundaries and Granularity**:
     - Each service is responsible for a specific business capability (e.g., `UserService` for user management, `PaymentService` for handling payments).
     - Services should be cohesive but not too granular to avoid excessive communication overhead.
  2. **RESTful APIs and Inter-Service Communication**:
     - Services interact through lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST or gRPC.
     - API design should ensure backward compatibility for easier service upgrades.
  3. **Service Discovery and Orchestration**:
     - **Service Discovery**: Mechanisms like Eureka or Consul dynamically locate services within the ecosystem.
     - **Orchestration**: Tools like Kubernetes manage deployment, scaling, and communication between services.

- **Advantages**:
  - Independent scalability and deployment.
  - Technology heterogeneity (each service can use different stacks).
  - Fault isolation (failures in one service don’t affect others).

- **Challenges**:
  - Increased complexity in communication and monitoring.
  - Managing data consistency across services.

---

### 7.2 Event-Driven Architecture
- **Concept**: Services communicate via asynchronous events rather than direct calls.  
- **Key Components**:
  1. **Event Sourcing**:
     - Events represent state changes (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "PaymentProcessed").
     - The system’s state is derived by replaying these events, enabling an auditable history.
  2. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**:
     - **Commands**: Handle write operations (e.g., placing an order, updating an address).
     - **Queries**: Handle read operations (e.g., retrieving order details).
     - Separate read and write models improve scalability and optimize each for its specific use case.
  3. **Message Brokers**:
     - Tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS enable reliable message delivery between producers and consumers.
     - They ensure decoupling between services by acting as intermediaries.

- **Advantages**:
  - Loosely coupled components with minimal dependencies.
  - Scalability and resilience to failures.
  - Real-time data processing and responsiveness.

- **Challenges**:
  - Managing eventual consistency across services.
  - Handling duplicate events or missed messages.

---

### 7.3 Distributed Systems Basics
- **Concept**: Distributed systems involve multiple nodes (computers) working together to appear as a single system.  
- **Key Concepts**:
  1. **CAP Theorem**:
     - States that a distributed system can only achieve **two out of three guarantees**:
       - **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
       - **Availability**: Every request receives a response (success or failure).
       - **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.
     - Trade-offs are made based on system needs (e.g., databases like MongoDB prioritize availability over consistency).
  2. **Data Partitioning and Replication**:
     - **Partitioning**: Splits data across multiple nodes (e.g., sharding in databases).
     - **Replication**: Duplicates data across nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
     - Challenges include ensuring consistent data updates and handling failures in partitions.
  3. **Consensus Algorithms**:
     - Mechanisms to ensure a consistent state across nodes in distributed systems.
     - Examples:
       - **Paxos**: A complex but widely used consensus algorithm.
       - **Raft**: A simpler alternative to Paxos, commonly used in systems like etcd and Consul.
     - Consensus is critical for leader election and distributed transactions.
